# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Myrthe van Baardwijk

Welcome to my GitHub page! I am a PhD researcher in bioinformatics researcher with a focus on data processing, data analysis and machine learning models for clinical, genomic and transcriptomic data. Ultimately aiming to improve individual patient care. Here, you will find projects related to my research interests and contributions to open-source tools in bioinformatics.

## ðŸ”¬ Current Research

Projects that I am currently working on include:
- **PISCES**: Pathology Spatial & Single CELL Omics. Development of analysis workflows for spatial and single-cell transcriptomics to support the pathology department within EMC.
- **PATH2XNAT**: Reproducible spatial transcriptomics and digital pathology workflows in Galaxy for COVID-19 data analysis.
- **Mongoose**: Multi-task learning for perturbation modelling in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data.
